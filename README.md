# Bugs-Life

This is my first big project.
This is simulation of how bugs live. Of course it's not precise and has no scientific power.
But it still very interisting to make set of creatures and watch of them interracting with each other
and environment. There are few specs of every creature. How creature looks highly depends on it specs.
If creature is a predator it has a white oval on his back perpendicular to his body.
If creature is herbivourous it has a white oval on his back parallel to to his body.
If creature is omnivourous it has both ovals.
The older the creature the longer it's tail
